### Abstract
In the past decade, social media has become a central part of many people’s lives. Studies show that almost 60% of the world’s population is on social media and 92% of people with internet are on social media1. While social media allows people to connect with others across the globe and form healthy connections, several recent studies have linked social media use to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety2. Addictiveness, feelings of loneliness, and self-doubt are only some of the most common negative effects of social media, particularly among teens3. This project uses D3.js, HTML, CSS, and Python to visualize data about how social media use affects mental health. 
I looked at datasets that allow us to make observations about a wide range of users, rather than a subset of social media users. This includes people of different ages, genders, and geographic locations. I processed the data from these datasets using the pandas Python library. I created interactive visualizations using the D3.js library, including a map, bar chart, and scatterplots. Interacting with these visualizations allows to notice that teens ages 16-20 tend to struggle the most with mental health. It is also seen that social media usage decreases as age increases, but the impact of social media does not have a clear correlation to age. When looking at data geographically, states that have reported better general health on average do not always have better mental health, and vice versa. Overall, these visualizations serve as a starting point for observers to understand how social media tends to affect mental health.
